    "- **Suggestions**:\n",
    "    - Team-Building Activities: Foster positive work relationships by organizing team-building activities, informal gatherings, and regular check-ins.\n",
    "    - Open Communication Channels: Develop a culture where employees feel comfortable providing feedback about workplace relationships, perhaps through anonymous surveys or regular feedback sessions.\n",
    "## Additional Initiatives\n",
    "    *1-* Employee Engagement Survey: Conduct quarterly surveys to track improvements in work-life balance, job involvement, and relationship satisfaction, adjusting strategies as needed.\n",
    "    *2-* Turnover Analysis by Role: Since departments and roles may vary in work conditions, consider customizing some of these strategies to meet specific department needs.\n",
